* Memmory Representation of 2D Array:-
					1) A 2D array can be visualized as a plain which has row and columns.
					2) Though mulyi-dimensional arrays are visualized as in thsi way they are actually stored in memory which is linear.(i.e linear)
					3) Hence a multi-dimension array is to be stored in one dimension.There are two ways to store mulyi-dimensional array in memory:-
							
							1) Row major order of storage.
							2) Column major order of storage.

		1) Row major:
				1) In row major order of storage the element of an array are stored row-wise.
				2) In C progmming language multidimensional arrays are stored in memory by using roe major format.
		2) Column major:
				1) In column major the element of an array are stored column-wise.
				2) Column major is used in languages likes FORTRAN,Motlab.
